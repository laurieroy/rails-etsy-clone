# EtsyClone - WIP

This is a two-sided marketplace for buyers and sellers:

Sellers will be able to:
 upload listings with images, 
 manage their inventory through a dashboard, and charge credit cards with the Stripe API. 

A small percentage cut of each transaction is transferred to the sellers.

Project inspired by an old baserails tutorial.
